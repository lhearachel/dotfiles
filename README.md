# dotfiles
This is a hosted version of my system configuration, including installation 
scripts supporting easy copy to and from the repo.

The core of my working environment is built around the following utilities:

- `bash`
- `neovim`
- `tmux`
- `alacritty`

I like these tools because they are easy to configure via plaintext files, and
thus their configuration is easily replicated across systems.

## Future Additions

- Whatever neovim plugins I decide stick with me

Much of this work comes from their efforts and tutorials, and I am immensely
